### Hi, I'm Chee Yeo

I am a software developer / writer with prior commercial experience working from startups through to corporations. 

My background is in computer science and I have been specializing in software development for the past 16 years.

In 2019, I decided to take the plunge and retrain in the fields of Machine Learning, Cloud Engineering and DevOps.

Since 2024, I am a certified AWS solutions architect professional: https://www.credly.com/badges/90284ec4-aa24-4fb9-8b43-c6f7437be1e7/public_url

Since 2025, I am a certified AWS DevOps Professional: https://www.credly.com/badges/e18704b7-e0b4-4378-9341-d4269e92b2b6/public_url

I write about my own research and development work at my personal blog: https://cheeyeo.xyz
