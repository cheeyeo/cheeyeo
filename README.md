### Hi, I'm Chee Yeo


I am a software developer / writer with prior commercial experience working from startups through to corporations. 

My background is in computer science and I have been specializing in web and software development for the past 10 years.

I decided to take the plunge and retrain in the fields of Machine Learning and DevOps.

I write about my own research and development work at my personal blog: https://cheeyeo.uk

My professional profile can be found at https://uk.linkedin.com/in/cheeyeo


I am also trying to create open source software to empower data science / ML workflows and have created an organization to publish some of this work: https://github.com/orgs/m1l0ai
